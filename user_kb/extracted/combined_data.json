Columbus had wanted Radcliffe for the role since he saw him in the BBC's production of David Copperfield before the open casting sessions had taken place but had been told by casting director Susan Figgis that Radcliffe's protective parents would not allow their son to take part. Columbus explained that his persistence in giving Radcliffe the role was responsible for Figgis' resignation. Radcliffe was asked to audition in 2000 when Heyman and Kloves met him and his parents at a production of Stones in His Pockets in London. Heyman and Columbus successfully managed to convince Radcliffe's parents that their son would be protected from media intrusion. They agreed to let him play Harry. Rowling approved of Radcliffe's casting, stating that \"having seen [his] screen test I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" Radcliffe was reportedly paid \u00a31 million for the film,",

Weeks later, the studio notified Columbus that he had got the job and sent him to Scotland to meet with Rowling and Heyman.[55] Columbus pitched his vision of the film for two hours, stating that he wanted the Muggle scenes \"to be bleak and dreary\" but those set in the wizarding world \"to be steeped in color, mood, and detail.\" He took inspiration from David Lean's adaptations of Great Expectations (1946) and Oliver Twist (1948), wishing to use \"that sort of darkness, that sort of edge, that quality to the cinematography,\" while being further inspired by the colour designs from Oliver!
